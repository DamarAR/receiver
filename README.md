## About this Project
In this repository, we have provided you a REST (REpresentational State Transfer) API project using Rocket web framework.

This project consists of four modules:
1.  `controller`: this module contains handler functions used to receive request and send responses.
    In Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, this is the Controller part.
2.  `model`: this module contains structs that serve as data containers.
    In MVC pattern, this is the Model part.
3.  `service`: this module contains structs with business logic methods.
    In MVC pattern, this is also the Model part.
4.  `repository`: this module contains structs that serve as databases.
    You can use methods of the struct to get list of objects, or operating an object (create, read, update, delete).

This repository provides a Rocket web framework skeleton that you can work with.

As this is an Observer Design Pattern tutorial repository, you need to implement a feature: `Notification`.
This feature will receive notifications of creation, promotion, and deletion of a product, when this receiver instance is subscribed to a certain product type.
The notification will be sent using HTTP POST request, so you need to make the receiver endpoint in this project.

## API Documentations

You can download the Postman Collection JSON here: https://ristek.link/AdvProgWeek7Postman

After you download the Postman Collection, you can try the endpoints inside "BambangShop Receiver" folder.

Postman is an installable client that you can use to test web endpoints using HTTP request.
You can also make automated functional testing scripts for REST API projects using this client.
You can install Postman via this website: https://www.postman.com/downloads/

## How to Run in Development Environment
1.  Set up environment variables first by creating `.env` file.
    Here is the example of `.env` file:
    ```bash
    ROCKET_PORT=8001
    APP_INSTANCE_ROOT_URL=http://localhost:${ROCKET_PORT}
    APP_PUBLISHER_ROOT_URL=http://localhost:8000
    APP_INSTANCE_NAME=Safira Sudrajat
    ```
    Here are the details of each environment variable:
    | variable                | type   | description                                                     |
    |-------------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
    | ROCKET_PORT             | string | Port number that will be listened by this receiver instance.    |
    | APP_INSTANCE_ROOT_URL   | string | URL address where this receiver instance can be accessed.       |
    | APP_PUUBLISHER_ROOT_URL | string | URL address where the publisher instance can be accessed.       |
    | APP_INSTANCE_NAME       | string | Name of this receiver instance, will be shown on notifications. |
2.  Use `cargo run` to run this app.
    (You might want to use `cargo check` if you only need to verify your work without running the app.)
3.  To simulate multiple instances of BambangShop Receiver (as the tutorial mandates you to do so),
    you can open new terminal, then edit `ROCKET_PORT` in `.env` file, then execute another `cargo run`.

    For example, if you want to run 3 (three) instances of BambangShop Receiver at port `8001`, `8002`, and `8003`, you can do these steps:
    -   Edit `ROCKET_PORT` in `.env` to `8001`, then execute `cargo run`.
    -   Open new terminal, edit `ROCKET_PORT` in `.env` to `8002`, then execute `cargo run`.
    -   Open another new terminal, edit `ROCKET_PORT` in `.env` to `8003`, then execute `cargo run`.

## Your Reflections
This is the place for you to write reflections:

### Mandatory (Subscriber) Reflections

#### Reflection Subscriber-1
1. In this tutorial, we used RwLock<> to synchronise the use of Vec of Notifications. Explain why it is necessary for this case, and explain why we do not use Mutex<> instead?

We use RwLock because the system handles many more reads than writes. It’s common for multiple users to access notifications at the same time, but new notifications are only added occasionally. RwLock is optimized for this kind of situation—it allows several threads to read simultaneously, while still ensuring only one thread can write when needed. In contrast, a Mutex blocks all other access—even reads—when one thread has the lock. This could create unnecessary bottlenecks in a read-heavy system, making RwLock the better choice here.

2. In this tutorial, we used lazy_static external library to define Vec and DashMap as a “static” variable. Compared to Java where we can mutate the content of a static variable via a static function, why did not Rust allow us to do so?

Rust takes a much stricter approach to memory safety than Java. While Java allows you to modify static variables freely through static methods, Rust prevents this to avoid data races and ensure thread safety. In Rust, you can’t just create a static Vec or DashMap and change it at will. You need proper synchronization tools to manage shared mutable state safely. That’s where libraries like lazy_static come in—they let you safely initialize static data with the necessary synchronization (like Mutex or RwLock) so the data can be used safely across threads.

#### Reflection Subscriber-2
1. Have you explored things outside of the steps in the tutorial, for example: src/lib.rs? If not, explain why you did not do so. If yes, explain things that you have learned from those other parts of code.

I haven’t explored beyond the tutorial instructions yet. My focus has been on completing the key components outlined in the guide, such as the controller, service, repository, and model modules. Since lib.rs wasn’t referenced in the tutorial, I chose to stick with the core tasks first before venturing into other parts of the codebase.

2. Since you have completed the tutorial by now and have tried to test your notification system by spawning multiple instances of Receiver, explain how Observer pattern eases you to plug in more subscribers. How about spawning more than one instance of Main app, will it still be easy enough to add to the system?

The Observer pattern makes adding new subscribers very simple. A subscriber just needs to send a subscription request, and the system adds it to the list of subscribers for the relevant topic. When a notification is sent, the system automatically goes through that list and delivers the notification to each subscriber. This modular setup means you can add new subscribers without changing the core logic.
As for running multiple instances of the Main app, it’s also manageable. Each Receiver can point to a specific instance using the APP_PUBLISHER_ROOT_URL, or you could use a routing mechanism to direct Receivers to the right instance. However, because each Main app keeps its own internal subscriber list, their data may differ unless a shared backend (like a database) is used to keep all instances synchronized.

3. Have you tried to make your own Tests, or enhance documentation on your Postman collection? If you have tried those features, tell us whether it is useful for your work (it can be your tutorial work or your Group Project).

I haven’t created custom tests or added documentation to the Postman collection yet. I’ve been concentrating on getting the tutorial features working correctly first. That said, I understand the importance of testing and documentation—they’re incredibly helpful for verifying API behavior and making the system easier to understand and work with in future projects.
